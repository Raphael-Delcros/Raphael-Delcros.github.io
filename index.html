    <h1>Welcome !</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name's Raphaël Delcros! I'm a big fan of video-games and TTRPGs (and between us,
      obsessed with dragons). I've started studying Computer Science since 2024 and was fascinated
      by it even before then. This website will contain a few projects I did at uni and later on
      will have more personnal projects. You can consider this website as one!
    </p>

        Passatemps is a three year long project about a second-hand board game reselling website,
        kind of like Vinted or France's Leboncoin. As it is a long project, it was done in a group.
        I am considered the P.O. of the project. We've had to do the whole concept from scratch,
        this includes making a graphic chart, mock-ups and wireframes, as well as a 120 pages long
        document describing in minute details the project.
