      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name's Raphaël Delcros! I'm a big fan of video-games and TTRPGs (and between us,
        obsessed with dragons). I've started studying Computer Science since 2024 and was fascinated
        by it even before then. This website will contain a few projects I did at uni and later on
        will have more personal projects. You can consider this website as one!

    <!-- PROJECTS -->
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div id="Passatemps">
      <h3>Passatemps</h3>
      <p>
        Passatemps is a three year long project about a second-hand board game reselling website,
        kind of like Vinted or France's Leboncoin. As it is a long project, it was done in a group.
        I am considered the P.O. of the project. We've had to do the whole concept from scratch,
        this includes making a graphic chart, mock-ups and wireframes, as well as a 120 pages long
        document describing in minute details the project.

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Like I said, you can consider this website as one of my projects. I'll expend on it as more
        projects get done, and I also want to add a language switch to toggle between French and
        English.

      <h3>CD player</h3>
      <p>
        As part of our university courses, we've had to learn Qt and work on a specific application.
        For our year's, it was a reproduction of a physical CD player. The user had to manually open
        and close the disk cover, and all analog buttons were reproduced on the app. It was also a
        functionnal music player.

    </div>
    <div id="spaceInvaders">
      <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
      <p>
        A failed project, but a project nonetheless. Our goal was to import a map of Bayonne and,
        with Djikstra, BFK or A* (shortest path algorithms), find the shortest path between a dozen
        landmarks about space invaders graffitis.

    <!-- EXPERIENCES -->
    <h2>Experiences</h2>

    <h3>2022 - Regard Félin la boutique</h3>
    <p>
      Regard Félin la boutique is an online shop selling cat products. There, I had the delight to
      learn all about e-commerce and how one was made. I delved into the specifics such as how to
      take good photos of products or how to make nice packages for parcels and, of course, met a
      lot of cats.
    </p>

    <h3>2020 - SELLSY</h3>
    <p>
      SELLSY is a Customer Relationship Management web application. I got to learn many things about
      User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI). Additionally, I had the opportunity to see the
      development side of the website, as well as Customer Assistance.
    </p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>
      I have participated in the "Nuit du code", a challenge where Computer Science students spent a
      whole night to create a website based on a theme. So far, I have only done the 2024 edition,
      but plan to do it again this year in 2025.
